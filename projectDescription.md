Project idea: 

- Our aim is to create a website where users can search for different activities such as skydiving, horse riding, swimming… etc. and register to participate in them. The activities will show up on the website based on any service providers that have registered on our website to present their activities and bring in customers. Once a user has selected an activity and they will see the information related to the activity including set dates and timings (set by the service provider) and if it suits them, they can apply to participate. We forward the user's information to the service provider and they deal with the customer when the customer shows up at the location for the activity. We will serve as a middle man between the users and service providers. 

- A website for activities/training such as skydiving, horse riding, swimming… etc. 
- The website establishes a direct communication link between service providers and users. 
- Service providers will be able to post their upcoming activities, so users can apply for them.
